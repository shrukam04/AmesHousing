# AmesHousing
In this assignment, I am using AmesHousing dataset provided by instructor. This assignment aims to conclude the best regression model. As per the instructions given, I will perform all 14 steps to fit, interpret and evaluate regression model.  The data set contains information from the Ames Assessors Office used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010.The data has 82 columns which include 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous variables (and 2 additional observation identifiers). First, I have created the environment by importing the required packages to analyze and create a visualization on the dataset.
